###### tags: `Game Desing` `Games` `GitHub`

## Description
You see yourself trapped in a space base full of zombies, some weapons, and a flash light, can you survive to the control room?
 
## Project 

This was a project that a used in Unity all that learn in the last months, and adds some new things as:

- Work with Animation, animation controller and Animation events
- Work with Draw Gizmo to debug
- Work with Raycast
- Work better with UI and Buttons
- Work with Enums (*on Unity*)
- And Try to play with Level Desing

## The Course 

I made this Game following the [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/) course from [GameDevTv](https://github.com/CompleteUnityDeveloper2) but I didnâ€™t do exactly as in the course, I didn't use their 3d assets and I didn't use post Render because my main focus its learn how to code with unit.

I had an amazing time making this game, it's my biggest project by now and despite it doesn't have sounds I really think it's my best project on unity until **now** (*12/2022*)

## Demo

Here's how the game its looking:
